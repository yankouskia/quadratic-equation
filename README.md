# Quadratic equation
Recall school math!

## Task
Your task is to implement `solveEquation` function, wihch solves Quadratic equation.
*Each* equality has exact 2 *integer* solutions. Return those numbers as ordered array.

Example:
```js
  const solutions = solveEquation('2 * x^2 - 10 * x + 12');
  console.log(solutions); // [2, 3]
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
*Be sure, that all tests are positive. That means you cannot catch any error in tests.*


## Prepare and test

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yankouskia/quadratic-equation.git`
- Go to folder `quadratic-equation`
- Run `npm install` in command line
- Run `npm test` in command line
- You will see the number of passing and failing tests
